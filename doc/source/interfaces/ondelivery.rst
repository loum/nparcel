On Delivery Comms Trigger
=========================

In addition to the "Sorry we missed you ..." scenario that redirects
parcels to an Alternate Delivery Point if the consumer is not present
at the nominated address to accept delivery, the Toll Parcel Portal
supports an On Delivery comms trigger.  In this case, a special
delivery type will suppress comms notifications during the initial
:mod:`nparcel.loader` until which time that the parcel was physically
delivered to the Alternate Delivery Point.  The delivery types that
require this additional level of processing are:

* **Primary Elect** - where the consumer is able to nominate an
  Alternate Delivery Point from where they will pick up the parcel

* **Priority Transfer out to V123 (Service Code 4)** or **Driver Transfer
  out to ADP (Service Code 2)**

On Delivery comms trigger is processed by the ``npondeliveryd`` daemon.
The ``npondeliveryd`` daemon polls alternate interfaces to identify
a delivery event at the Alternate Delivery Point.

Parcels that are Pending Delivery
---------------------------------

Parcels that are pending delivery to an Alternate Delivery Point present
in the Toll Parcel Portal as:

* not being picked up (``jobitem.pickup_ts`` is ``NULL``)

* not having notifications set (``jobitem.notify_ts`` is ``NULL``)

* not aged (``jobitem.created_ts`` less than 14 days old)

* have a ``job.service_code`` 3 (Primary Elect) or 4 (Priority Transfer
  out to V123)

* are configured to generate On Delivery Comms as per
  :ref:`sc4_ondelivery_bu_ids` or :ref:`primary_elect_ondelivery`

Parcels (``job_items``) within Toll Parcel Portal that exhibit these traits
are extracted via the SQL query provided by
:meth:`nparcel.table.jobitem.uncollected_jobitems_sql`.  From here,
``npondeliveryd`` will poll the alternate interfaces for a delivered event.

``npondeliveryd`` Interfaces
----------------------------

The alternate interfaces used include:

* **TransSend** (polled by default)

* **TCD**

.. note::

    MTS was deprecated as part of release 0.28

All interfaces are polled by default.

.. _transsend:

TransSend
+++++++++

TransSend is an Oracle DB interface that can be used to identify
delivered parcels for **Priority** and **IPEC** (not **Fast**).  A typical
query set is shown below:

.. image:: ../_static/transsend_query.png
   :align: center
   :alt: TransSend query set

``npondeliveryd`` uses the ``CONNOTE_NUMBER`` / ``ITEM_NUMBER`` TransSend
columns to identify a parcel.  If found, it will check the
``LATEST_SCAN_EVENT_ACTION`` value for ``DELIVERED`` before setting the
comms events files.

.. note::

    as of **version 0.26**, comms are suppressed if the
    ``LATEST_SCANNER_DESCRIPTION`` contains
    ``IDS - TOLL FAST GRAYS ONLINE``.  This is required to suppress comms
    for **IPEC** to **Fast** overflow deliveries.

TCD
+++

New in **version 0.28**, ``npondeliveryd`` now takes a daily extraction
from TCD.  TCD push their report files to the Toll Parcel Portal FTP
interface.  Typical contents are as follows::

    MKL5050005831       20140211 00393403250088959404   20140212
    MKL5050005831       20140211 00393403250088959398   20140212

These line items are read as four space-separated columns where:

* column 1 -- ``Consignment Number``
* column 2 -- ``Despatch Date``
* column 3 -- ``Item Number``
* column 4 -- ``Delivery Date``

Should the ``Consignment Number`` / ``Item Number`` lookup result in a
valid ``Delivery Date`` value then ``npondeliveryd`` will generate a
comms events file.

Comms Templates
---------------

The delivery scenario (either **Primary Elect** or **Priority Transfer** out
to V123) will determine the type of comms template to use.  Primary Elect is
standard and simply uses the ``pe`` template.  For example, if
``job_item.id`` 12345 triggers an On Delivery event, then (if configured)
the comms events files generated include::

    $ ls -1 /data/nparcel/comms
    $ email.12345.pe
    $ sms.12345.pe

**Priority Transfer out to V123** defaults to the standard ``body``
template.  However, as of *release 0.26* is behavior can be altered
to use the ``delay`` template as detailed in the
:ref:`sc4_template_selection`

``npondeliveryd`` Usage
-----------------------

``npondeliveryd`` is a CLI-based daemoniser that controls the
On Delivery comms trigger process::

    $ npondeliveryd -h
    usage: npondeliveryd [options] start|stop|status
    
    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose         raise logging verbosity
      -d, --dry             dry run - report only, do not execute
      -b, --batch           single pass batch mode
      -c CONFIG, --config=CONFIG
                            override default config
                            "/home/npprod/.nparceld/nparceld.conf"
    -f FILE, --file=FILE  file to process inline (start only)

``npondeliveryd`` Configuration Items
-------------------------------------

The ``npondeliveryd`` utility uses the default ``nparceld.conf`` file to
control processing workflows.

* ``tcd_filename_format``

    TCD Delivery Report filename format as expressed as a Python
    regular expression string (default ``TCD_Delivery_\d{14}\.DAT``)

* ``file_cache_size``

    processing loop.  Additonal files are deleted from the system
